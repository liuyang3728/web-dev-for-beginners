To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. Do you take everything out of the refrigerator to make your sandwich? 
No, you only take out the items you would like to use on your sandwich.
Destructuring is exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working with, 
but we only need some of the items contained in these.
Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.
