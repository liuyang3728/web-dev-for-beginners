                    <strong>
                        Welcome!
                    </strong> 
                    My name is Liu Yang, and I have a background as an IT supporter and network engineer. Throughout my career, I’ve faced a variety of challenges that have helped me grow in both roles, and this self-instruction highlights my journey and key lessons I’ve learned.

                    I started in IT support, which laid the foundation for my understanding of technology. This role taught me how to troubleshoot hardware and software issues, manage installations, and provide excellent customer service. One of the first skills I gained was hardware troubleshooting. Whether it was repairing printers or resolving computer issues, I learned how vital it is to have a deep understanding of devices. IT support isn’t just about fixing technical problems; it’s also about helping people. Being able to communicate clearly, especially when clients are frustrated, is key to resolving issues smoothly.
                    
                    Managing software installations and keeping systems up to date was another important part of the job. Ensuring that operating systems, security software, and applications were current helped prevent larger problems. As I handled network-related tasks such as resolving internet connectivity issues or troubleshooting IP conflicts, my interest in networking grew.
                    
                    Transitioning to network engineering was a natural next step in my career. Network engineers design, implement, and manage networks, ensuring that they run efficiently and securely. In this role, I was responsible for designing LANs, setting up routers, switches, and configuring firewalls. I also learned about virtual private networks (VPNs) and wide area networks (WANs). As cyber threats evolved, I became more involved in network security, setting up firewalls and monitoring network traffic for potential threats.
                    
                    One of the most rewarding aspects of network engineering is optimizing wireless networks. Ensuring that Wi-Fi connections are stable and fast in business environments required understanding signal interference and positioning access points effectively. Monitoring network performance is another critical task, which I handled using tools like Wireshark and SolarWinds to detect issues before they affected users.
                    
                    In recent years, I have shifted focus to cloud networking. Working with platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure introduced new challenges and opportunities, and I’ve been learning how to design and manage virtual networks in the cloud. Cloud technologies are becoming increasingly important, and gaining expertise in cloud networking is vital for staying competitive in the IT field.
